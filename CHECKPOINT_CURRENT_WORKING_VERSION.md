# Checkpoint: Current Working Version (v3.2.0)

**Date:** 2025-07-13

## Summary
This checkpoint captures the current, stable working version of the AWS Bedrock Partner Management System as of July 13, 2025 (v3.2.0).

### Key Features and Improvements
- **User-Driven Truncation & Analysis Settings**: All truncation, SQL query limits, and analysis parameters are now fully user-configurable from the frontend settings UI. The backend always honors these settings, ensuring end-to-end control and transparency for users.
- **Centralized Model Settings**: All model inference parameters (max tokens, temperature, etc.) are now managed exclusively in Bedrock prompt management. The backend no longer sets or overrides these values, ensuring a single source of truth and easier model governance.
- **Backend Logic & Logging**: All backend logic and logs now reflect the actual user settings received with each request, not hardcoded or default values. This ensures accurate debugging, traceability, and user trust.
- **Robust Settings UI & Backend Wiring**: The settings UI is fully integrated with backend logic, providing a seamless, robust, and user-friendly experience for configuring all analysis parameters.
- **Bug Fixes**: Truncation is only applied if enabled, and settings are always correctly propagated from frontend to backend.
