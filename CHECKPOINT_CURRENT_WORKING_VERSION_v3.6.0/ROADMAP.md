- **Eliminated Default Values**: Removed empty strings, arrays, objects, and numeric fallbacks to prevent silent failures
- **Enhanced Error Visibility**: Clear error identification throughout the application for faster troubleshooting
- **Improved User Experience**: Users now see explicit error messages instead of confusing default values

âœ… **Professional Debug Suite**: Implemented comprehensive debugging infrastructure including:

- **SQL Query Generation Process**: Real-time monitoring of Bedrock SQL generation with model configuration and process status indicators
- **Analysis Generation Process**: Advanced payload analysis with size monitoring, token estimation, and risk assessment
- **User-Configurable Settings**: Settings management interface for SQL query limits (50-500 records), truncation limits, and debug preferences
- **Real-time Logging Capture**: Backend console log capture and frontend display with comprehensive data flow tracing
- **Interactive Debug Controls**: Professional UX with status indicators, risk assessment displays, and multi-format data viewing

  âœ… **Professional Debug UX**: Enhanced debug panels with professional design and user-friendly controls
  âœ… **User-Driven Truncation & Analysis Settings**: All truncation, SQL query limits, and analysis parameters are now fully user-configurable from the frontend settings UI and honored end-to-end by the backend.
  âœ… **Centralized Model Settings**: All model inference parameters (max tokens, temperature, etc.) are now managed exclusively in Bedrock prompt management. The backend no longer sets or overrides these values.
  âœ… **Backend Logic & Logging**: All backend logic and logs now reflect the actual user settings received with each request, not hardcoded or default values. This ensures accurate debugging, traceability, and user trust.
  âœ… **Robust Settings UI & Backend Wiring**: The settings UI is fully integrated with backend logic, providing a seamless, robust, and user-friendly experience for configuring all analysis parameters.
  âœ… **Lambda Timeout Resolution**: Fixed Lambda execution timeouts by extending timeout from 10s to 30s with proper error handling
  âœ… **Production Backend Stability**: Successfully migrated to stable production backend (`app.js`) with full AWS integration
  âœ… **Settings System Integration**: Properly integrated with comprehensive settings management system for all data manipulation
  âœ… **Performance Monitoring**: Added `/api/debug/performance` endpoint for real-time system health monitoring
  âœ… **Bedrock Integration Fixed**: Resolved Bedrock analysis issues by fixing invalid prompt version parameters and implementing proper Converse API
  âœ… **Architecture Simplification**: Removed Nova Premier complexity and standardized on Claude 3.5 Sonnet model for consistency
  âœ… **Modern API Implementation**: All Bedrock interactions now use modern Converse API for reliable communication
  âœ… **UI Layout Optimization**: Fixed progress indicator positioning and resolved layout jumping issues
  âœ… **Documentation Updates**: Comprehensive updates to all documentation reflecting latest architecture and capabilities
  âœ… **Multi-Environment Infrastructure**: Complete AWS Organizations, Control Tower, and CI/CD pipeline implementation
  âœ… **Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery**: Multi-region deployment with automated backup and failover capabilities
  âœ… **Enhanced User Documentation**: Complete user guides, workflow templates, and field reference documentation
  âœ… **Enterprise Security**: Comprehensive security controls, compliance monitoring, and governance implementation
