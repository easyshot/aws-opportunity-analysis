# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves conducting a comprehensive analysis of the existing AWS Opportunity Analysis application codebase to create complete documentation covering architecture, data flow, frontend-backend connections, user journeys, configuration requirements, and deployment readiness. The analysis will provide a thorough understanding of how all components work together and identify any missing functionality or broken connections to ensure successful production deployment.

5. WHEN documenting state changes THEN the system SHALL document state changes, validations, and user feedback including loading indicators, error messages, and success notifications
6. WHEN checking utilization THEN the system SHALL identify unused backend endpoints or frontend components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want complete user journey mapping, so that I can understand how users navigate through the application and identify any broken flows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mapping user flows THEN the system SHALL document complete user flows for all major features
2. WHEN documenting navigation THEN the system SHALL show how users navigate through the application
3. WHEN identifying issues THEN the system SHALL identify broken or incomplete user journeys

6. WHEN documenting workflows THEN the system SHALL create step-by-step workflows for each major user task

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a complete credentials and configuration checklist, so that I can properly configure all environments and ensure secure deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inventorying variables THEN the system SHALL inventory all environment variables needed for development and production
2. WHEN listing credentials THEN the system SHALL list all API keys, database connections, and third-party service credentials
3. WHEN identifying hardcoded values THEN the system SHALL identify hardcoded values that need to be moved to environment variables
4. WHEN checking authentication THEN the system SHALL check for missing authentication tokens or secrets
5. WHEN creating templates THEN the system SHALL create a template .env.example file with all required variables
6. WHEN documenting usage THEN the system SHALL explain what each credential/variable is used for

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want a deployment readiness assessment, so that I can understand what needs to be configured for production deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing deployment THEN the system SHALL identify what needs to be configured for production deployment
2. WHEN documenting build processes THEN the system SHALL list all build processes and dependencies
3. WHEN checking development code THEN the system SHALL check for development-only code that needs to be removed
4. WHEN verifying requirements THEN the system SHALL verify all production environment requirements
5. WHEN identifying security issues THEN the system SHALL flag any security concerns or vulnerabilities
6. WHEN checking CORS THEN the system SHALL check for proper CORS configuration
7. WHEN verifying database setup THEN the system SHALL verify database migrations and seeding requirements

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want a comprehensive testing and validation guide, so that I can systematically test all functionality and verify integrations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating test processes THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step process to test all major user flows
2. WHEN creating integration checklists THEN the system SHALL create a checklist to verify frontend-backend integration
3. WHEN documenting interaction testing THEN the system SHALL provide guidance to test each button/form/interaction on every page
