# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves activating the existing comprehensive AWS Opportunity Analysis application that has already been built. The application currently uses app-debug.js (mock data) instead of the full app.js (real AWS integrations). The goal is to systematically activate the real AWS services, validate the integrations, and ensure the frontend at http://localhost:3123/index-compact.html connects properly to the backend services. All the code is already implemented - we just need to activate and validate the connections.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate that all AWS services are accessible, so that I can confirm the existing integrations will work properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing AWS connectivity THEN the system SHALL validate access to Bedrock, Lambda, Athena, DynamoDB, and EventBridge services
2. WHEN AWS credentials are valid THEN the system SHALL successfully authenticate with all required services
3. WHEN testing Bedrock prompts THEN the system SHALL verify that the configured prompt IDs exist and are accessible
4. WHEN checking Lambda functions THEN the system SHALL confirm the catapult_get_dataset function exists and is invokable
5. WHEN validating Athena THEN the system SHALL confirm database access and S3 output location permissions
6. WHEN connectivity fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages indicating which services need setup

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to switch from debug mode to production mode, so that real AWS services replace mock data responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the application THEN the system SHALL use app.js instead of app-debug.js for the backend server
2. WHEN the frontend makes API calls THEN the system SHALL route requests to the real AWS integration endpoints
3. WHEN analysis is requested THEN the system SHALL execute the full automation workflow (query generation → Lambda execution → Bedrock analysis)
4. WHEN switching modes THEN the system SHALL maintain the same API interface so the frontend continues to work
5. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide meaningful error messages while falling back gracefully
6. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logging for troubleshooting

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to deploy the required AWS infrastructure, so that the Lambda functions and other services are available.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL create the catapult_get_dataset Lambda function with proper permissions
2. WHEN setting up Athena THEN the system SHALL ensure the database and S3 output location are configured
3. WHEN configuring Bedrock THEN the system SHALL verify prompt access and model permissions
4. WHEN deploying DynamoDB tables THEN the system SHALL create tables for caching and session management
5. WHEN setting up EventBridge THEN the system SHALL create the custom event bus for application events
6. WHEN infrastructure is ready THEN the system SHALL validate all components work together

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to work with real data, so that I can see actual AI-powered analysis instead of mock responses.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN submitting the opportunity form THEN the system SHALL process the request through real AWS services
2. WHEN analysis completes THEN the frontend SHALL display actual predictions from Bedrock AI models
3. WHEN viewing results THEN the system SHALL show real historical project matches from Athena queries
4. WHEN using funding analysis THEN the system SHALL provide real AI-generated funding recommendations
5. WHEN requesting follow-on opportunities THEN the system SHALL execute the multi-step workflow with real data
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly messages while maintaining functionality

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to validate the end-to-end workflow, so that I can confirm all integrations work properly together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing the complete workflow THEN the system SHALL successfully execute query generation → data retrieval → analysis → response formatting
2. WHEN monitoring the process THEN the system SHALL log each step for validation and debugging
3. WHEN testing different scenarios THEN the system SHALL handle various input types and edge cases
4. WHEN validating responses THEN the system SHALL ensure all expected data fields are populated correctly
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL handle failures gracefully with appropriate fallbacks
6. WHEN performance testing THEN the system SHALL complete analysis within acceptable time limits

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement proper error handling and monitoring, so that issues can be identified and resolved quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN AWS service calls fail THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff
2. WHEN monitoring the application THEN the system SHALL track key metrics and performance indicators
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging while showing user-friendly messages
4. WHEN service quotas are exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle throttling gracefully
5. WHEN network issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate fallback responses
6. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide comprehensive logging without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to optimize the application for production use, so that it performs well under real-world conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN caching is enabled THEN the system SHALL use DynamoDB and Redis for intelligent result caching
2. WHEN handling concurrent requests THEN the system SHALL manage resources efficiently
3. WHEN optimizing performance THEN the system SHALL implement connection pooling and resource reuse
4. WHEN scaling the application THEN the system SHALL handle increased load gracefully
5. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL track response times and resource utilization
6. WHEN optimizing costs THEN the system SHALL implement efficient resource usage patterns

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want all advanced features to work properly, so that I can access the complete analysis capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Nova Premier model THEN the system SHALL provide enhanced analysis with the premium Bedrock model
2. WHEN requesting funding analysis THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive funding recommendations
3. WHEN exploring follow-on opportunities THEN the system SHALL identify potential future business opportunities
4. WHEN viewing analysis results THEN the system SHALL display all six analysis sections with rich formatting
5. WHEN exporting results THEN the system SHALL provide professional export and print capabilities
6. WHEN using advanced features THEN the system SHALL maintain the same performance and reliability standards

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing and validation tools, so that I can ensure the application works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN testing AWS connectivity THEN the system SHALL provide health check endpoints for all services
2. WHEN validating integrations THEN the system SHALL include test scenarios for each major workflow
3. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL provide detailed diagnostic information
4. WHEN testing performance THEN the system SHALL validate response times and resource usage
5. WHEN testing error scenarios THEN the system SHALL validate error handling and recovery mechanisms
6. WHEN deploying changes THEN the system SHALL run automated validation tests

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear operational procedures, so that the application can be maintained and updated effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying updates THEN the system SHALL support zero-downtime deployments
2. WHEN monitoring production THEN the system SHALL provide operational dashboards and alerts
