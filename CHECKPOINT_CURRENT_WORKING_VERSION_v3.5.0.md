# Checkpoint: Current Working Version v3.5.0

## Overview
This checkpoint represents the current working version of the AWS Bedrock Partner Management System as of July 16, 2025. This version includes all recent enhancements, particularly the standardized error handling implementation.

## Key Features in v3.5.0
- **Standardized Error Handling**: Replaced all fallback values with consistent 'ERROR: Data not received' message throughout the application
- **Eliminated Default Values**: Removed empty strings, arrays, objects, and numeric fallbacks to prevent silent failures
- **Enhanced Error Visibility**: Clear error identification throughout the application for faster troubleshooting
- **Improved User Experience**: Users now see explicit error messages instead of confusing default values

## Technical Implementation
- All fallback values in `app-clean.js` have been replaced with the standardized error message
- No additional fallback values were found in other JavaScript files that needed fixing
- The changes maintain the application's functionality while improving error visibility

## Benefits
1. **Improved Error Visibility**:
   - No more silent failures with empty strings, arrays, or objects
   - Clear distinction between actual data and missing data
2. **Better User Experience**:
   - Users receive explicit feedback when data is missing
   - No confusion from seeing default values that appear valid
3. **Enhanced Debugging**:
   - Developers can quickly identify where data flow breaks
   - Consistent error format makes troubleshooting more efficient
4. **Development Best Practices**:
   - Follows proper error handling patterns
   - Makes the application more maintainable

## Documentation Updates
The following documentation files have been updated to reflect these changes:
- README.md
- CHANGELOG.md
- ROADMAP.md
- product.md
- structure.md
- .kiro/steering/tech.md

## Next Steps
- Continue monitoring for any remaining fallback values that might need standardization
- Consider implementing more detailed error messages that provide context about what data is missing
- Explore adding error recovery mechanisms to handle missing data gracefully

This checkpoint serves as a reference point for the current working version with standardized error handling implemented throughout the application.
