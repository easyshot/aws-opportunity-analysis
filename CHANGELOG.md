## [3.2.0] - 2025-07-13
### User-Driven Truncation, Centralized Model Settings, and Robust Settings Wiring

#### Added - User-Driven Analysis Settings
- **User-Configurable Truncation & Analysis Settings**: All truncation, SQL query limits, and analysis parameters are now fully user-configurable from the frontend settings UI. The backend always honors these settings, ensuring end-to-end control and transparency for users.

#### Changed - Model Settings Management
- **Centralized Model Settings**: All model inference parameters (max tokens, temperature, etc.) are now managed exclusively in Bedrock prompt management. The backend no longer sets or overrides these values, ensuring a single source of truth and easier model governance.

#### Changed - Backend Logic & Logging
- **Settings-Driven Logic**: All backend logic and logs now reflect the actual user settings received with each request, not hardcoded or default values. This ensures accurate debugging, traceability, and user trust.
- **Robust Settings UI & Backend Wiring**: The settings UI is fully integrated with backend logic, providing a seamless, robust, and user-friendly experience for configuring all analysis parameters.

#### Fixed - Truncation and Settings Bugs
- **Truncation Logic**: Fixed issues where truncation was applied even when disabled in user settings. Now, truncation is only applied if explicitly enabled by the user.
- **Settings Propagation**: Fixed issues with settings not being passed correctly from frontend to backend in some flows.
