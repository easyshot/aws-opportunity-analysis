# Product Specification: AWS Bedrock Partner Management System

## Overview
The AWS Bedrock Partner Management System is a serverless, AI-powered application for analyzing business opportunities, generating funding recommendations, and identifying follow-on opportunities. It leverages AWS Bedrock (Claude 3.5 Sonnet), Lambda, Athena, DynamoDB, and other AWS services to deliver real-time analytics and actionable insights through a modern web interface.

## User Flows
- **Opportunity Analysis**: Users enter opportunity details (customer, region, close date, name, description) and trigger an analysis. The system generates a SQL query, retrieves historical data, and uses Bedrock to produce a comprehensive analysis.
- **Settings Management**: Users configure truncation, SQL query limits, and analysis parameters via the frontend. These settings are honored end-to-end, impacting data processing and analysis results.
- **Debug & Monitoring**: Users and admins can access real-time debug panels, view data flow, and monitor system health and performance.

## Data Collection & Processing
- **Input**: Opportunity details collected via a validated form.
- **Processing**: SQL query generated by Bedrock, executed via Lambda/Athena. Results are truncated or limited based on user settings. Analysis is performed by Bedrock using the latest prompt configuration.
- **Output**: Six core analysis areas (methodology, findings, risk factors, similar projects, rationale, full analysis), summary metrics (ARR, MRR, launch date, duration, confidence, top services), funding and follow-on sections.

## User Interaction
- **Modern Dashboard**: Real-time validation, progress tracking, and interactive debug panels.
- **Settings UI**: Full control over truncation, query limits, and analysis parameters.
- **Export/Print**: Professional export and print functionality for reports.

## System Behavior
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with structured JSON responses and detailed logs.
- **Performance**: Lambda timeout extended to 30s; backend optimized for large datasets and real-time feedback.
- **Security**: IAM roles, encryption, secrets management, and compliance controls.
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch, X-Ray, and custom endpoints for health and performance.

## Analysis Flow Summary
1. User submits opportunity details and settings.
2. Backend generates SQL query using Bedrock.
3. Lambda executes query; results are truncated/limited as per settings.
4. Bedrock analyzes data and returns structured results.
5. Frontend displays results, debug info, and allows export.

## User-Driven Settings Impact
- All truncation, query limits, and analysis parameters are user-configurable and respected throughout the workflow, ensuring transparency and control.
