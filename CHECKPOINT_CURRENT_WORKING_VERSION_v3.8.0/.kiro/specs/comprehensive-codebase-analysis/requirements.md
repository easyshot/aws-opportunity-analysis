# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves conducting a comprehensive analysis and documentation of the AWS Opportunity Analysis application codebase. The analysis will provide complete understanding of application architecture, data flows, frontend-backend connections, user journeys, configuration requirements, and deployment readiness. This documentation will serve as a complete reference for understanding how all components work together and enable successful production deployment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete application architecture and flow analysis, so that I can understand how data moves through the entire system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing the architecture THEN the system SHALL map out the complete data flow from frontend to backend with step-by-step descriptions
2. WHEN documenting API endpoints THEN the system SHALL identify all API endpoints and their specific purposes
3. WHEN analyzing authentication THEN the system SHALL show how authentication/authorization works throughout the entire application
4. WHEN documenting data storage THEN the system SHALL explain the database schema and all relationships between tables/collections
5. WHEN analyzing integrations THEN the system SHALL document any third-party integrations and dependencies
6. WHEN creating visual documentation THEN the system SHALL create a visual flowchart or diagram showing the navigation and interaction flow between pages and components

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete frontend documentation for every page and component, so that I can understand all user interface elements and their functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documenting pages THEN the system SHALL provide page purpose and expected content for each route in the application
2. WHEN documenting UI elements THEN the system SHALL list all UI elements including buttons, forms, inputs, menus, cards, and modals
3. WHEN documenting controls THEN the system SHALL specify what each button/control should do when clicked/used
4. WHEN documenting triggers THEN the system SHALL identify what user action triggers each control
5. WHEN documenting connections THEN the system SHALL specify which specific backend endpoint or API call each control connects to
6. WHEN documenting permissions THEN the system SHALL identify required user permissions/authentication state for each control
7. WHEN documenting states THEN the system SHALL document loading states, error states, and success states
8. WHEN documenting validation THEN the system SHALL identify any validation requirements
9. WHEN documenting navigation THEN the system SHALL map navigation flow between pages
10. WHEN documenting state management THEN the system SHALL show how data flows through the frontend
11. WHEN documenting components THEN the system SHALL list all components and their props/functionality
12. WHEN identifying gaps THEN the system SHALL identify missing UI elements or incomplete features

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete frontend-backend connection audit, so that I can verify all integrations are working correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN auditing connections THEN the system SHALL list every frontend API call and corresponding backend endpoint
2. WHEN tracing user interactions THEN the system SHALL trace the complete flow: User action → Frontend validation → API call → Backend processing → Response → UI update
3. WHEN identifying issues THEN the system SHALL identify missing or broken connections
4. WHEN verifying error handling THEN the system SHALL verify error handling between frontend and backend
5. WHEN documenting state changes THEN the system SHALL document state changes, validations, and user feedback including loading indicators, error messages, and success notifications
6. WHEN checking usage THEN the system SHALL check for unused backend endpoints or frontend components

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complete user journey mapping, so that I can understand how users navigate through the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN mapping user flows THEN the system SHALL document complete user flows for all major features
2. WHEN documenting navigation THEN the system SHALL show how users navigate through the app
3. WHEN identifying issues THEN the system SHALL identify broken or incomplete user journeys
4. WHEN documenting access control THEN the system SHALL document what happens when users access pages they shouldn't
5. WHEN mapping roles THEN the system SHALL map out different user roles and their permissions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a complete credentials and configuration checklist, so that I can properly configure all environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN inventorying variables THEN the system SHALL inventory all environment variables needed for development vs production
2. WHEN listing credentials THEN the system SHALL list all API keys, database connections, and third-party service credentials
3. WHEN identifying hardcoded values THEN the system SHALL identify hardcoded values that need to be moved to environment variables
4. WHEN checking authentication THEN the system SHALL check for missing authentication tokens or secrets
5. WHEN creating templates THEN the system SHALL create a template .env.example file with all required variables
6. WHEN explaining usage THEN the system SHALL explain what each credential/variable is used for

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a deployment readiness assessment, so that I can understand what needs to be configured for production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN assessing deployment THEN the system SHALL identify what needs to be configured for production deployment
2. WHEN listing processes THEN the system SHALL list all build processes and dependencies
3. WHEN checking code THEN the system SHALL check for development-only code that needs to be removed
4. WHEN verifying requirements THEN the system SHALL verify all production environment requirements
5. WHEN identifying security issues THEN the system SHALL flag any security concerns or vulnerabilities
6. WHEN checking CORS THEN the system SHALL check for proper CORS configuration
7. WHEN verifying database THEN the system SHALL verify database migrations and seeding

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a comprehensive testing and validation guide, so that I can verify all functionality works correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN providing testing process THEN the system SHALL provide step-by-step process to test all major user flows
2. WHEN creating checklists THEN the system SHALL create a checklist to verify frontend-backend integration
3. WHEN testing interactions THEN the system SHALL test each button/form/interaction on every page
4. WHEN suggesting testing THEN the system SHALL suggest how to test in a production-like environment
5. WHEN identifying automation THEN the system SHALL identify automated testing needs
6. WHEN providing scenarios THEN the system SHALL provide manual testing scenarios

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a production launch checklist, so that I can successfully deploy the application to production.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating checklist THEN the system SHALL create a simple, actionable checklist for production launch
2. WHEN documenting frontend deployment THEN the system SHALL include frontend deployment steps
