## Recommended Restoration Approach

### Option 1: Full Revert (RECOMMENDED)

3. **Clean restoration**: Full working version restored immediately

### Option 2: Selective Restoration

   - `public/index.html` from v3.6.0
   - `public/styles-compact-option-c.css`
   - `public/settings-modal.css`
   - `public/app-compact-option-c.js`
2. **Update HTML script references**
3. **Test functionality restoration**

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach
1. **Restore working interface** (v3.6.0 frontend)
2. **Preserve backend improvements** from v3.7.0
3. **Merge beneficial changes** selectively

## Implementation Commands

### Full Revert (Recommended)
```bash
# Create backup of current work
git branch backup-v3.7.0 HEAD

# Revert to working version
git reset --hard cb38efc

# Verify restoration
npm start
```

### Selective Restoration
```bash
# Restore key working files
git show cb38efc:public/index.html > public/index.html
git show cb38efc:public/styles-compact-option-c.css > public/styles-compact-option-c.css
git show cb38efc:public/settings-modal.css > public/settings-modal.css
