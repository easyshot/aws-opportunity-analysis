# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Partner Opportunity Intelligence application's index-compact.html page has a broken dark mode theme toggle functionality. Users are experiencing light areas on what should be a dark screen because the theme toggle button is not functional. The CSS contains comprehensive dark mode styles, but the JavaScript implementation is missing the toggle function, preventing users from switching between light and dark themes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user of the Partner Opportunity Intelligence application, I want to toggle between light and dark themes, so that I can use the interface in my preferred visual mode and reduce eye strain in low-light conditions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the theme toggle button THEN the application SHALL switch between light and dark themes
2. WHEN the application is in dark mode THEN all UI elements SHALL display with dark backgrounds and light text
3. WHEN the application is in light mode THEN all UI elements SHALL display with light backgrounds and dark text
4. WHEN the user toggles the theme THEN the theme preference SHALL be saved to localStorage for persistence across sessions
5. WHEN the application loads THEN it SHALL restore the user's previously selected theme from localStorage

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the theme toggle button to provide clear visual feedback about the current theme state, so that I can understand which theme is currently active.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is in light mode THEN the theme toggle button SHALL display a moon icon and "Dark" text
2. WHEN the application is in dark mode THEN the theme toggle button SHALL display a sun icon and "Light" text
3. WHEN the user hovers over the theme toggle button THEN it SHALL provide visual feedback with hover effects
4. WHEN the theme changes THEN the button icon and text SHALL update immediately to reflect the new state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all interface elements to properly support both light and dark themes, so that the visual experience is consistent and professional in both modes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in dark mode THEN all panels, forms, and content areas SHALL use dark backgrounds with appropriate contrast
2. WHEN in dark mode THEN all text elements SHALL be light-colored for proper readability
3. WHEN in dark mode THEN all borders and dividers SHALL use appropriate dark theme colors
4. WHEN switching themes THEN the transition SHALL be smooth and immediate without visual glitches
5. WHEN in either theme THEN all interactive elements SHALL maintain proper contrast ratios for accessibility
