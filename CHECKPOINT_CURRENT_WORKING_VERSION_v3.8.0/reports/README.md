# AWS Connectivity Validation Reports

This directory contains reports generated by the AWS service connectivity validation tools.

## Report Types

### Connectivity Reports
- `aws-connectivity-report.json` - Full AWS service connectivity validation
- `aws-connectivity-report.txt` - Human-readable version of the connectivity report
- `infrastructure-validation-report.json` - Infrastructure readiness assessment
- `connectivity-test-summary.json` - Combined test suite results

### Report Structure

Each JSON report contains:
- **metadata**: Timestamp, environment, region information
- **summary**: Overall health status and statistics
- **services**: Detailed results for each AWS service tested
- **recommendations**: Actionable recommendations for issues found
- **nextSteps**: Suggested next steps based on results

### Human-Readable Reports

Text versions of reports are also generated for easy reading and sharing:
- Clear status indicators (✅ ✗ ⚠️)
- Detailed check results
- Specific error messages and recommendations
- Summary statistics

## Using the Reports

1. **Review Overall Status**: Check the summary section for quick health overview
2. **Identify Issues**: Look for services marked as 'unhealthy' or 'degraded'
3. **Follow Recommendations**: Each failed check includes specific recommendations
4. **Track Progress**: Compare reports over time to track improvements

## Report Retention

Reports are automatically timestamped and can be kept for historical tracking. Consider:
- Archiving old reports periodically
- Comparing reports before and after infrastructure changes
- Using reports for compliance and audit purposes

## Integration with CI/CD

These reports can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines:
- Fail builds if critical services are unhealthy
- Generate reports as build artifacts
- Send notifications based on report results
