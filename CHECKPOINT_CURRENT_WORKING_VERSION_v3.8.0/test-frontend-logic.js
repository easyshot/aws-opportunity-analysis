  methodology:
    "This analysis was conducted using AWS Bedrock's Claude 3.5 Sonnet model with a comprehensive dataset of 155 historical project records. The methodology involved pattern recognition, similarity analysis, and predictive modeling to assess market opportunity and risk factors.",
  findings:
    "The analysis reveals a strong market opportunity with high confidence (85%). Key findings include: 1) Strong alignment with successful historical projects, 2) Favorable market conditions in the target region, 3) Competitive advantages in the proposed solution, 4) Positive customer feedback patterns from similar engagements.",
  riskFactors:
    "Risk assessment indicates a low to moderate risk profile. Primary risks include: 1) Market volatility in the target sector (15% probability), 2) Resource availability constraints (10% probability), 3) Competitive pressure from established players (20% probability). Mitigation strategies are recommended for each identified risk.",
  similarProjects:
    "Found 12 comparable projects with similar characteristics: 8 successful implementations, 3 moderate success, 1 challenging project. Average deal size: $2.3M, Average implementation time: 18 months, Success rate: 92%. Key similarities include customer profile, technical requirements, and market conditions.",
  rationale:
    "The analysis rationale is based on comprehensive data analysis of 155 historical records. The high confidence level (85%) is supported by: 1) Strong pattern matching with successful projects, 2) Favorable market indicators, 3) Proven technology stack alignment, 4) Experienced team availability. The data quality and quantity provide sufficient basis for reliable predictions.",
