### Recovery Objectives
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 15 minutes
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour
- **Availability Target**: 99.9% uptime
- **MTTR (Mean Time To Recovery)**: 30 minutes

### Manual Recovery Procedures
- **Primary Region Restoration**: Step-by-step procedures in runbook

- **Service Monitoring**: DynamoDB, S3, Lambda, Route 53
- **Custom Metrics**: Business KPIs and operational metrics
- **Real-time Dashboards**: CloudWatch dashboards for visibility

### Alert Levels
- **Critical**: Service completely unavailable (immediate response)
- **Warning**: Degraded performance or partial failures (15-minute response)
- **Info**: Operational notifications (1-hour response)

### Notification Channels
- **SNS Topics**: Multi-level alert distribution
- **Email Notifications**: For all alert levels
- **SMS Notifications**: For critical alerts only
- **Escalation Matrix**: Automated escalation procedures

## Testing and Validation

### Automated Testing
- **Health Check Tests**: Continuous endpoint monitoring
- **Replication Tests**: Data consistency validation
- **Backup Tests**: Recovery point verification
- **Failover Simulation**: Automated failover testing

### Testing Schedule
- **Health Checks**: Every 5 minutes (continuous)
- **Backup Validation**: Weekly
- **Failover Tests**: Monthly
- **Full DR Drill**: Quarterly

### Test Scenarios
- Primary region complete outage
- Database service degradation
- Storage service interruption
- Lambda function failures
- Network partition scenarios

## Security and Compliance

### Encryption
- **At Rest**: All data encrypted using AWS KMS
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.2+ for all communications
- **Key Management**: Automatic key rotation enabled

### Access Control
- **Cross-account Roles**: Secure cross-region access
- **MFA Required**: For all administrative operations
- **Least Privilege**: Minimal required permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive CloudTrail logging

### Compliance
- **Data Residency**: Region-specific data storage
- **Retention Policies**: Automated data lifecycle management
- **Audit Requirements**: Complete audit trail maintenance

## Cost Optimization

### Storage Optimization
- **Intelligent Tiering**: Automatic cost optimization for S3
- **Lifecycle Policies**: Automated transition to cheaper storage classes
- **Backup Optimization**: Cold storage for long-term retention

### Compute Optimization
- **On-demand Billing**: Pay-per-use for DynamoDB
- **Reserved Capacity**: For predictable workloads
- **Spot Instances**: Not used for DR (reliability priority)

### Budget Management
- **Monthly Budgets**: Environment-specific cost limits
- **Alert Thresholds**: 50%, 80%, 100% of budget
- **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time cost tracking and optimization
