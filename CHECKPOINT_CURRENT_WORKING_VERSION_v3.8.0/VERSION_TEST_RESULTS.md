**Why v3.6.0 is the Best Choice**:
1. **Complete Professional Interface** - "Partner Opportunity Intelligence" branding

4. Create a development branch for future improvements

### üîÑ **If You Want to Preserve v3.7.0 Work**:

**Recommendation**: Immediately revert to v3.6.0 and use it as your stable base for any future development.
