### 7. Test Orchestration

**Scripts Created:**
- `scripts/run-comprehensive-tests.js` - Main test orchestrator
- `scripts/deploy-testing-infrastructure.js` - Infrastructure deployment
- Package.json scripts for all test types

**Execution Options:**
- Quick tests (skip slow tests)
- Comprehensive tests (all test types)
- Individual test type execution
- Custom configuration support

## Usage Instructions

### Deploy Testing Infrastructure

```bash
# Deploy all testing infrastructure
npm run testing:deploy

# Deploy specific components
npm run testing:deploy-load
npm run testing:deploy-chaos
npm run testing:deploy-synthetic
npm run testing:deploy-security
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all

# Run quick tests (skip slow ones)
npm run test:quick

# Run specific test types
npm run test:security
npm run test:performance
npm run test:contract
npm run test:load
```

### Configuration

Set environment variables for customization:

```bash
export TARGET_URL=https://your-app.com
export NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=alerts@yourcompany.com
export CONCURRENT_USERS=25
export TEST_DURATION=300
```

## Monitoring and Alerting

### CloudWatch Dashboards

- **Load Testing Dashboard**: Artillery metrics and performance data
- **Chaos Engineering Dashboard**: Fault injection results
- **Synthetic Monitoring Dashboard**: Availability and performance trends
- **Security Monitoring Dashboard**: Vulnerability findings and risk scores

### SNS Notifications

Automated alerts for:
- Critical security findings
- Performance degradation
- Load test failures
- Chaos experiment results
- Synthetic monitoring failures

### CloudWatch Alarms

- API availability below 95%
- Response time above 25 seconds
- Critical security findings detected
- Security risk score above 75

## Integration with Multi-Environment Deployment

The testing infrastructure is integrated with the multi-environment deployment strategy:
