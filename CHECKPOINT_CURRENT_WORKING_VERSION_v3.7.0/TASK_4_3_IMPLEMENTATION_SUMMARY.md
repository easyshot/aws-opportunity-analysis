# Task 4.3 Implementation Summary

## Enhanced Findings, Rationale, and Risk Factors Display Sections

### Overview
Successfully implemented Task 4.3 to create detailed findings, rationale, and risk factors display sections with bullet points, key insights highlighting, clear reasoning, historical data correlations, severity levels, and mitigation strategies.

### Implementation Details

#### 1. HTML Structure Enhancements
- **Enhanced Findings Section**: Added comprehensive structure with summary stats, findings list, and action buttons
- **Enhanced Rationale Section**: Implemented structured display with reasoning points and historical correlations
- **Enhanced Risk Factors Section**: Created detailed risk assessment with severity levels and mitigation strategies
