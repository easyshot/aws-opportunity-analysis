node scripts/validate-end-to-end-workflow.js

# Test frontend integration (Requirement 5.5)
node scripts/test-frontend-integration.js

# Run comprehensive validation suite
node scripts/run-end-to-end-validation.js
```

## Prerequisites

### Environment Setup
- Backend server running on port 8123 (production mode with app.js)
- Frontend server running on port 3123 (optional for some tests)
- AWS credentials configured in environment variables
- All required AWS services deployed and accessible

### Required Environment Variables
```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key

# Bedrock Prompt IDs
CATAPULT_QUERY_PROMPT_ID=Y6T66EI3GZ
CATAPULT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT_ID=FDUHITJIME
